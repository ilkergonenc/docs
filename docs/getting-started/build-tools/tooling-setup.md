## Tooling setup

Bend UI uses [npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts) for its build system. Our `package.json` includes convenient methods for working with the framework, including compiling code, running tests, and more.

To use our build system and run our documentation locally, you'll need a copy of Bend UI's source files and Node. Follow these steps and you should be ready to rock:

1. [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), which we use to manage our dependencies.
2. Navigate to the root `/bend.ui` directory and run `npm install` to install our local dependencies listed in `package.json`.
3. And start running gulp command.

When completed, you'll be able to run the various commands provided from the command line.
